# AR-Based-Indoor-Navigation-System
Unity AR provides real-time rendering of interactive maps and overlays on mobile screens, enabling seamless indoor navigation. Ideal for multi-level buildings like malls, hospitals, and universities, it scans an initial image to determine the user's position and dynamically generates a guided path using AR overlays, ensuring precise navigation
AR-Based Indoor Navigation System
AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) SYSTEM FOR INDOOR NAVIGATION USING UNITY

Overview
The AR-Based Indoor Navigation System is designed to help users navigate indoor spaces where GPS signals are weak or unavailable. This project uses Unity AR to provide real-time, interactive navigation by overlaying digital paths on the real-world environment.

Features
- Real-time AR Navigation – Guides users with visual AR overlays.
- Unity AR Integration – Uses Unity for precise object tracking and rendering.
- 3D Room Simulation – Custom-built 3D models for an immersive experience.
- Mobile App Support – Can be exported as an APK for Android devices.

Technologies Used
- Unity 6000.1.12f1 – Primary development platform
- AR SDK – For real-time navigation rendering
- MATLAB – Used for initial object detection and tracking
- C# (Unity Scripting) – Controls AR interactions
- Android Deployment – Compiled as a mobile app (APK)

Project Structure
AR-Based-Indoor-Navigation
 ┣ Assets/         - Unity 3D models and scripts
 ┣ Scenes/        - Unity project scenes
 ┣ main.unity     - Main AR navigation scene
 ┣ README.md      - Project documentation (this file)

How It Works
1. User scans a starting point – The app identifies the user's location.
2. AR path is generated – The system overlays navigation arrows in real-time.
3. User follows AR directions – The app guides them to the selected destination.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/suryabhag/AR-Based-Indoor-Navigation.git
cd AR-Based-Indoor-Navigation

2. Open in Unity
- Install Unity 6000.1.12f1
- Open the project in Unity Hub
- Load the main.unity scene

3. Run the Project
- Click Play in Unity
- Test the navigation system

4. Build and Deploy as APK (Android Users)
- Go to File → Build Settings
- Select Android as the target platform
- Click Build and Run

Results
The system successfully provides turn-by-turn AR navigation, displaying a blue-colored path for guidance. The app allows users to navigate within structured indoor spaces efficiently.
